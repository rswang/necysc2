		         					<strong>Is knowing Chinese necessary at camp? If my child does not know Chinese, will he/she fit in?</strong><br>
		         					Knowing Chinese is not necessary to attend NECYSC. The majority of classes are taught in English. The only exception is some of the teachers we have from Taiwan only speak Mandarin. However, there is always a CIT or Counselor to translate. Not everyone at camp can speak Chinese; some speak Cantonese, some speak Mandarin, some only speak English.

		         					<strong>Does my child need to know how to swim?</strong><br>
		         					The child has the option not to swim.  There is staff supervision of kids who do not want to swim.  The Regis pool has lifeguards manning the pool during swim.  A swim test is given to the kids on the first day.  Furthermore, Counselors and CITs are usually in the pool with the campers and a number of them are also certified lifeguards. Tell your child to let his/her Counselor/CIT know if s/he is not comfortable in
									the water.

		         					We will mail out the acceptance letter around April 15 if we have received your application by April 1 application deadline.  All applications after the deadline will be processed if space is still available. If you have to know the status before April 15, please contact registration@necysc.org.

		         					<strong>Why can't you simply accept everyone who applies for camp?</strong><br>
		         					There are many factors that affect the size of the camp, such as room availability, staff to campers ratio, and the number of campers our license permits.

		         					<strong>Why can't I bring my health forms on the 1st day of camp?</strong><br>
		         					Our medical staff has to go over every health form before camp begins, and we have a total of more than 250 campers (including CITs). That is why we require all health forms to received by June 1. If you have difficulty to meet the deadline due to special reasons, please contact registration@necysc.org.

		         					<strong>What is the priority consideration application?</strong><br>
		         					By committee consensus, return campers have a two week window from the date of open registration to complete the registration process.  Completion is defined as a completed registration form AND the postmark date on the envelope in which the check is mailed.  Postmark date may not be any later than two weeks from the date of open registration.  Applications sent by return campers after the two week deadline will be pooled with new camper applications. After all return campers are accepted, new applicants are accepted based upon completion of the registration process. Postmark date is used for setting priority.

		         					For accepted camper there is a $50 non-refundable handling fee charged (per camper) for withdrawal before May 1. No refunds will be made after May 1. There is a $25 fee for changing programs after May 1.

		         					<strong>Why is it that I was placed on the waiting list while campers who registered after me are enrolled?</strong><br>
		         					We reserve spaces for returning campers who apply before the priority application date. After that date, enrollment is based on a first come first serve basis. However, due to space and resource limitations we may have to adjust our acceptance and placement guidelines as necessary. For example, we need to accept overnight campers based on certain gender ratio due to the bathroom and security issues.

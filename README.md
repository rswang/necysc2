6.470<br>Rachel WangMilestone 11.  What problem does your application address, and how does your application address it?<br>I am rebuilding a website for a camp that I go to. The current website (<a href="http://www.necysc.org">necysc.org</a>) is extremely old and has poor UI/UX. The backend is also pretty old (although reliable) but I would like to take a different approach to make it.2.	What are the killer features of your application?<br>In order of priority:<ul><li>Campers and staff can create accounts, register online, and see the status of their application.</li><li>Campers can submit online forms.</li><li>Committee/staff can easily run database queries (without using code to run their own queries).</li><li>A system for parents to submit their "Parent on Duty" preferences and an algorithm to make a "Parent on Duty" schedule for the camp.</li></ul>3.	Identify and briefly describe your target demographic. Who do you envision using your site?<br>Campers, their parents, and the committee. There are 500+ campers/staff each year who need to apply/register.<br>4.	Develop at least one use case for your site. This should be a list or table demonstrating a sequence of user actions and website responses that occur when a user attempts to complete a core task on your site. Make sure to indicate the task the user is trying to complete.<br>A parent wants to register a new camper.<ul><li>Visits home page and clicks on 'Apply'.</li><li>Website asks for username/password login. </li><li>Camper has no account yet, so she will choose 'New User'.</li><li>Parent completes application and submits.</li><li>After submitting, website will redirect to status page, which will list the status of the camper's application as well as the remaining steps.</li></ul>1.	Draw out, by hand, three different designs for this page. Scan these for your submission.<br>2.	Make a list of 3 pros and 3 cons for each design.![design_ideas](https://raw.github.com/rswang/necysc/master/design_ideas.jpeg)3.	Pick the best design and mock it up using an image editing program (i.e. Photoshop or Gimp) or using HTML/CSS. Submit a screenshot of this mockup.see necysc.html1.	What features do you plan to implement? How critical are they to the proper functioning of your application?<br>For the MVP, I plan on completing at least the first critical feature as listed above (Campers and staff can create accounts, register online, and see the status of their application.) This is critical to the website and that is one of its main functions.<br>2.	What features do you plan to leave out? How critical are they to the proper functioning of your application?<br>I will complete as many of the features as listed above as possible, but the four feature is defintiely my smallest priroity.<br>3.	Are there any other aspects of your application that are reduced in your MVP? Examples including limited fake datasets, stylistic concerns, security concerns, etc.<br>There may be security concerns since campers enter sensitive data (SSN, birthdays, etc.). I plan on populating the website with dummy data. Realistically, I will be able to launch the front-end before registration opens in February but the Committee would like to keep the current back-end, especially because of security concerns with the data and an untested system.<br>1.  Who is in your team? You may list at most 3 people (4 if you are not competing in the main division). For each member list the full legal name, .edu e-mail, school, major(s), year, and graduate/undergraduate status. For each team member, also indicate whether they are registered to take the class for credit. <br>No one else.<br>2.	Which of the themes does your application match best? Be as brief as you can.<br>None.<br>3.	What technology do you plan to use for your server-side programming (e.g. PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc)?<br>The current system is written in PHP and MySQL, so I am thinking of using that for consistency and so that I can integrate the new and old website. However, I'm strongly considering using Ruby on Rails since its the newer technology. <br>4.	What risks do you envision preventing you from successfully implementing your idea? Consider this an exercise of imagination, not a test of confidence.<br>As I've never done any web programming and don't have much familiarity with programming languages besides Python, I am worried that I have my knowledge is too limited to implement a secure site with good coding practices. Also, I might get too carried away with front-end and not have as much time to make the back-end in time for the end of IAP.<br>5.	Are you planning to participate in the competition? If so, are you competing in the main division or the rookie division? Your answer will solely be used for planning purposes.<br>Neither.<br>
